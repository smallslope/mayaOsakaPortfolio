They sold it to Camberwell Vestry in September 1857 and the Green re-opened as a public open space in 1859. The Green was previously dominated by elm trees and had a pond in the south.",

The garden predated the buildings and was laid out in 1887, the opening ceremony taking place in 1888. It was created to provide 'an open air sitting room for the tired inhabitants of Southwark' and had an elaborate layout of curved lawns, flower beds and serpentine paths, an ornamental pond with fountain, bandstand and covered children's play area. There were once two mosaics in the garden, that depicting 'The Sower' remains, restored in 1956 and again in 2005. During WWII the railings were removed for the war effort and the caretaker dismissed, and by 1948 the layout of the garden had disappeared. Sir Sidney Cockerell writing to The Times of his visit in July 1948 found 'a desolate flat space part of it newly asphalted'. The garden appears treeless in a photograph of 1965, although some trees were subsequently planted. It was not until 2005 that it was restored to much of its original layout through the work of Bankside Open Spaces Trust with support by local people and funding from HLF and Southwark Council. It reflects its Victorian origins as a community garden and combines C19th and ecological planting.",

The original layout had a wide carriage drive around the perimeter, part of which survives; various facilities were added by 1885, including a new lake and a bandstand, and in the early C20th a lido and the Ada Salter Rose Garden were among the new facilities. Rundown in the latter C20th, it was very well restored by 2001 with HLF funding, the works including a replica bandstand and bowling pavilion, and the lake restored to its original pre-WWII size and the main gates repaired.

Improvement works were carried out in 2001 by Little Dorrit Park Group, set up by group of local mothers including artist Danuta Solowig Wedderburn who created bronze plaques. Works included playground improvements and landscaping and the park is supported by Bankside Open Spaces Trust (BOST).",

The square was laid out some time between 1800 and 1810. The fourth, northern, side of the square was home to one of south London’s first swimming baths, which opened in 1820. Another outdoor pool opened a few years later, also on the canal bank, behind the houses on the east side of the square…\nAt the peak of the squares decline, in the 1960s, South London gangsters the Richardson brothers, Charlie and Eddie, established Peckford scrap merchants in nearby New Church Road, and a base in the square, at number 33. They later spent a lot of time in gaol, and their exploits have been documented in books, films and an art show in the square.\nThe council refuse depot on the north side later formed the basis of the first piece of recreational land in the area, which was eventually to become Burgess Park.",

By 1813 it appears to have had a formal layout but it was much simplified by 1870. Threatened with development in the late C19th, the garden was saved for public open space by the MPGA in 1909, and laid out by their landscape gardener Madeline Agar. The cruciform layout was restored and the garden opened to the public in 1910. In the centre is a rose garden with sundial; a tree was planted here on 14 September 1991 to celebrate the bicentenary of West Square. The garden at one point had 4 black mulberries.",

Existing green spaces were incorporated into the new North Camberwell Open Space, which by 1965 covered c.16 hectares. It was named Burgess Park in 1973 after Alderman Jessie Burgess, first lady Mayor of Camberwell. The fragmented open spaces were consolidated from 1982 onwards and in 1985/6 Southwark Council took over responsibility and began purchasing remaining properties and clearing the site, a process completed in 1995. Numerous projects have been undertaken, including planting 1000s of trees, provision of sports facilities, greening the canal route and creation of the lake. Within the park are the former Chumleigh Gardens Almshouses, which now house a café, meeting rooms as well as a World Garden and an English Garden.\n\n*Due to the complex evolutionary nature of the formation of Burgess Park, the London Parkive has chosen to depict Burgess Parks opening date as 1995, at the point at which its consolidation was completed.
