In 1856 four local dignitaries purchased exclusive rights for holding the fair on the Green from the Lords of the Manor on a 1,000 year lease with an annual rent of one peppercorn. They sold it to Camberwell Vestry in September 1857 and the Green re-opened as a public open space in 1859. The Green was previously dominated by elm trees and had a pond in the south.",

A drinking fountain was donated by John Passmore Edwards. When the church was bombed, the cross fell into the churchyard scorching the ground, its position now marked by a stone cross in the grass. The garden was redesigned in 2000.",

For a time it was leased to a local builder but in the 1890s part was purchased by Bermondsey Vestry for a much-needed public recreation ground, opening as Nelson Recreation Ground in 1899. Although it was refurbished after WWII war damage it became run down. It was renamed and refurbished after local residents set up Friends of Guy Street Park in 2001 following community consultation. It re-opened in 2003 with improved lighting, seating, play areas, a community garden and a community artwork that also provided illumination.",

The garden predated the buildings and was laid out in 1887, the opening ceremony taking place in 1888. It was created to provide 'an open air sitting room for the tired inhabitants of Southwark' and had an elaborate layout of curved lawns, flower beds and serpentine paths, an ornamental pond with fountain, bandstand and covered children's play area. There were once two mosaics in the garden, that depicting 'The Sower' remains, restored in 1956 and again in 2005. During WWII the railings were removed for the war effort and the caretaker dismissed, and by 1948 the layout of the garden had disappeared. Sir Sidney Cockerell writing to The Times of his visit in July 1948 found 'a desolate flat space part of it newly asphalted'. The garden appears treeless in a photograph of 1965, although some trees were subsequently planted. It was not until 2005 that it was restored to much of its original layout through the work of Bankside Open Spaces Trust with support by local people and funding from HLF and Southwark Council. It reflects its Victorian origins as a community garden and combines C19th and ecological planting.",

After he moved to Surrey, Evelyn let Sayes Court, including for a short time to Peter the Great of Russia in 1698, who was studying ship building at the Royal Dockyard nearby. The mansion was demolished in 1729 and a workhouse built on the site, later converted as almshouses by a descendent of Evelyn. In 1878 he laid out part of the land as a recreation ground initially for his tenants, but later a park of 1.5 acres was opened as a public facility. Requisitioned during WWII, the park was later re-landscaped by the LCC and opened in 1952.",

It was replaced by a new building in 1976, now London City Mission, which rises out of the remains of the old walls. The churchyard was in use until 1853. Adjoining it was a paupers' burial ground of St Olave's, now part of Potters Fields Park. St John's churchyard was laid out as public gardens in 1882. The C18th Watch House is within the garden, and C18th Vicarage is just outside.",

The medieval church building was rebuilt in the seventeenth century, and later added to and restored, particularly in 1883.",

Pressure for a public park in the area began in the 1850s and in 1857 the new Metropolitan Board of Works was persuaded that Bermondsey and Rotherhithe, as well as Finsbury, were most in need and a site was approved. Southwark Park was laid out by the MBW and opened on 19 June 1869. The original layout had a wide carriage drive around the perimeter, part of which survives; various facilities were added by 1885, including a new lake and a bandstand, and in the early C20th a lido and the Ada Salter Rose Garden were among the new facilities. Rundown in the latter C20th, it was very well restored by 2001 with HLF funding, the works including a replica bandstand and bowling pavilion, and the lake restored to its original pre-WWII size and the main gates repaired. Other facilities include a cafe, visitor’s centre, art gallery, sports track and wildlife area.",

When the riverside area became derelict, an ecology park was created here in 1977, remaining until 1985. The park combining these two areas was laid out in 1988 and opened as Potters Fields Park, recalling the pottery works that had existed here in the C17th. The park was re-designed in 2007. When it first opened as a recreation ground in the late C19th, the park was known as The Tooley Street Garden, but it was re-named Potters Fields Park in 2006.",

It was created as a children's playground by the LCC's Parks and Open Spaces Committee, and was opened in 1902 by the LCC Councillor for Rotherhithe, Mr A Pomeroy-Cragg, at a ceremony accompanied by music from the North London Prize Band. Improvement works were carried out in 2001 by Little Dorrit Park Group, set up by group of local mothers including artist Danuta Solowig Wedderburn who created bronze plaques. Works included playground improvements and landscaping and the park is supported by Bankside Open Spaces Trust (BOST).",

Rotherhithe had strong maritime connections, with many seafarers among its parishioners. In 1620 The Mayflower sailed from here to pick up the Pilgrim Fathers, and three of its four part-owners were buried in Rotherhithe churchyard. An unusual memorial in the churchyard is that of Prince Lee Boo (d.1784), the son of the King of the Belau Islands, whose monument was erected by the East India Company. The churchyard immediately adjacent to the church was opened to the public in 1909, while the main part of the churchyard had been opened as a public garden in 1901, now called St Mary's Churchyard Gardens.",

After 1787 Dulwich tenants lost their common rights following the Enclosure Acts, although the woods survived until the development of Crystal Palace following the Great Exhibition, which led to housing development. The steep slope of woodland running west from Sydenham Hill became the gardens of several Victorian houses, since demolished, their gardens are now back within the woodland. Although the gardens have disappeared, evidence remains in the form of exotic garden trees, and fragments of built features. Also within the woods is the disused railway track of the Crystal Palace High Level Railway.",

The architect was Charles Barry and Son and the site was donated by Dulwich College. The foundation stone was laid by the famous actor Sir Henry Irving on 24 September 1896 and the library was declared open by Lord Chancellor Halsbury on the 24 November 1897.\n\nThe building probably originally operated on a closed access system where books could be selected from a catalogue and retrieved by staff for viewing. The original single-storey wing to the west of the main entrance was rebuilt in about 1950 following bomb damage in 1940 or 1941.\n\nThe building was refurbished in 2013.",

It was named after the Oak of Honor that marked the boundary of lands belonging to the Honour of Gloucester. The most famous story in its history is that Elizabeth I rested under an oak at the summit in 1602, and the third successive specimen planted in 1905 remains today. In 1896 the hill was enclosed when the adjacent Golf Club rented the land, but following an active local protest it was eventually opened as a public park in 1905, the LCC General Powers Bill of 1902 having enabled Camberwell Borough Council to compulsorily purchase the land as public open space.",

The shrubbery adjoins the nearby listed houses in Holly Grove built between 1816 and 1822, fronted by cast iron railings. The land between South Grove and the rear of houses in Elm Grove was purchased by Camberwell Borough Council in 1896 for £966, which represented paving charges from which the owners were released, and the land was laid out as a shrubbery with the pathway along its length and opened to the public in 1897. It was extended In 1902 when further land was purchased for £350.",

Part of the site was later lost as a result of road schemes when the Bricklayers Arms Flyover was built in 1970 although a strip of land was added to the west as compensation and planted with shrubs. Improvements have been carried out since 2009 as part of wider improvements to the Salisbury Row neighbourhood.",

When the Bethlehem Royal Hospital moved to St George's Fields, its senior hospital staff needed accommodation nearby and West Square was laid out with terraces surrounding the garden. By 1813 it appears to have had a formal layout but it was much simplified by 1870. Threatened with development in the late C19th, the garden was saved for public open space by the MPGA in 1909, and laid out by their landscape gardener Madeline Agar. The cruciform layout was restored and the garden opened to the public in 1910. In the centre is a rose garden with sundial; a tree was planted here on 14 September 1991 to celebrate the bicentenary of West Square. The garden at one point had 4 black mulberries.",

It was the result of initiatives such as the Abercrombie Plan of 1943 and was created by demolishing numerous houses, streets, churches and factories, and infilling the disused Grand Surrey Canal. Existing green spaces were incorporated into the new North Camberwell Open Space, which by 1965 covered c.16 hectares. It was named Burgess Park in 1973 after Alderman Jessie Burgess, first lady Mayor of Camberwell. The fragmented open spaces were consolidated from 1982 onwards and in 1985/6 Southwark Council took over responsibility and began purchasing remaining properties and clearing the site, a process completed in 1995. Numerous projects have been undertaken, including planting 1000s of trees, provision of sports facilities, greening the canal route and creation of the lake. Within the park are the former Chumleigh Gardens Almshouses, which now house a café, meeting rooms as well as a World Garden and an English Garden. Due to the complex evolutionary nature of the formation of Burgess Park, the London Parkive has chosen to depict Burgess Parks opening date as 1995, at the point at which its consolidation was completed. You can refer to the areas that were opened before this time by viewing the map through the Alterations View Mode.",

It was the result of initiatives such as the Abercrombie Plan of 1943 and was created by demolishing numerous houses, streets, churches and factories, and infilling the disused Grand Surrey Canal. Existing green spaces were incorporated into the new North Camberwell Open Space, which by 1965 covered c.16 hectares. It was named Burgess Park in 1973 after Alderman Jessie Burgess, first lady Mayor of Camberwell. The fragmented open spaces were consolidated from 1982 onwards and in 1985/6 Southwark Council took over responsibility and began purchasing remaining properties and clearing the site, a process completed in 1995. Numerous projects have been undertaken, including planting 1000s of trees, provision of sports facilities, greening the canal route and creation of the lake. Within the park are the former Chumleigh Gardens Almshouses, which now house a café, meeting rooms as well as a World Garden and an English Garden. Due to the complex evolutionary nature of the formation of Burgess Park, the London Parkive has chosen to depict Burgess Parks opening date as 1995, at the point at which its consolidation was completed. You can refer to the areas that were opened before this time by viewing the map through the Alterations View Mode.",

Addington Square was built between 1810 and 1850, when the area was still mostly fields and market gardens, and became home to the well-to-do escaping densely populated central London. It had a canal and two swimming baths by 1840…. The square forms part of the earliest housing to be developed in the park area, dating from the beginning of the 19th century. The square was laid out some time between 1800 and 1810. The fourth, northern, side of the square was home to one of south London’s first swimming baths, which opened in 1820. Another outdoor pool opened a few years later, also on the canal bank, behind the houses on the east side of the square… At the peak of the squares decline, in the 1960s, South London gangsters the Richardson brothers, Charlie and Eddie, established Peckford scrap merchants in nearby New Church Road, and a base in the square, at number 33. They later spent a lot of time in gaol, and their exploits have been documented in books, films and an art show in the square. The council refuse depot on the north side later formed the basis of the first piece of recreational land in the area, which was eventually to become Burgess Park.",

It opened in 1869 and remained here until 1976 although it was later re-established in a new building next to St Thomas' Hospital. After the hospital closed the buildings were demolished and the site became green space. Mint Street Park was re-landscaped by Bankside Open Spaces Trust (BOST) working with local people to carry out improvements that included new landscaping, access and lighting. Raised beds were created and planted by the gardening club working with Putting Down Roots, a project run by St Mungo's Association working with homeless people. Mint Street Park is now s a local play space and venue for community events, and includes an adventure play facility.",
