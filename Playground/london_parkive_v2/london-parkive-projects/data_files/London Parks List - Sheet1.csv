At that time there were a number of green spaces already in existence and the LCC General Powers Act of 1952 contained provision for these to be transferred from the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell to the LCC for incorporation into the North Camberwell Open Space including Sumner Road Recreation Ground, which had opened in 1900.",https://londongardenstrust.org/conservation/inventory/site-record/?ID=SOU012

Buckenham Square Garden,,Southwark,51.49477,-0.08722,Defunct,1906,1900-1924,Closed,Uncertain,1921,By drawing comparisons between an Ordnance Survey map dated 1944-1972 with Open Street Maps (2024) we were able to determine that Buckenham Square has been incorporated into St Saviour's and St Olave's Church of England School and as such no longer exists or the land that it stood on is no longer accessible to the public.,

When the houses were demolished and replaced by a Board School the garden survived and was purchased by the Vestry of St George the Martyr. It was laid out as public garden by the MPGA and once had a bandstand. Part of the site was later lost as a result of road schemes when the Bricklayers Arms Flyover was built in 1970 although a strip of land was added to the west as compensation and planted with shrubs.

When the Bethlehem Royal Hospital moved to St George's Fields, its senior hospital staff needed accommodation nearby and West Square was laid out with terraces surrounding the garden. By 1813 it appears to have had a formal layout but it was much simplified by 1870. Threatened with development in the late C19th, the garden was saved for public open space by the MPGA in 1909, and laid out by their landscape gardener Madeline Agar. The cruciform layout was restored and the garden opened to the public in 1910. In the centre is a rose garden with sundial; a tree was planted here on 14 September 1991 to celebrate the bicentenary of West Square.

Burgess Park,"Sumner Road Recreation Ground, Addington Square Gardens",Southwark,51.48330,-0.08213,Open,1995,1975-1999,Expanded,n/a,n/a,"Work began after WWII to provide the new public space that eventually became Burgess Park. It was the result of initiatives such as the Abercrombie Plan of 1943 and was created by demolishing numerous houses, streets, churches and factories, and infilling the disused Grand Surrey Canal. Existing green spaces were incorporated into the new North Camberwell Open Space, which by 1965 covered c.16 hectares. It was named Burgess Park in 1973 after Alderman Jessie Burgess, first lady Mayor of Camberwell. The fragmented open spaces were consolidated from 1982 onwards and in 1985/6 Southwark Council took over responsibility and began purchasing remaining properties and clearing the site, a process completed in 1995. Numerous projects have been undertaken, including planting 1000s of trees, provision of sports facilities, greening the canal route and creation of the lake. Within the park are the former Chumleigh Gardens Almshouses, which now house a café, meeting rooms as well as a World Garden and an English Garden.

*Due to the complex evolutionary nature of the formation of Burgess Park, the London Parkive has chosen to depict Burgess Parks opening date as 1995, at the point at which its consolidation was completed.
