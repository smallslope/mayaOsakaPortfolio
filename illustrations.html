                        ‘The Box’ is an endearing term my family use to describe my mum’s house. This is a (fairly) accurate depiction of The Box, drawn in detail, though the garden may look a little neater in the illustration than in real life… and in real life it’s not floating on the sea…

                    <p class = "description">
                        ‘Even Monkeys Fall From Trees’, is a Japanese saying which I encountered as a child when playing a card game called Karuta. The message behind the phrase is that even a master at something can fail. I felt that this would be the perfect slogan for an insurance company; for the unexpected perils that happen in our lives. The layout of this illustration is inspired by Karuta cards.

                    <p class = "description">
                        This is a series of screen prints that I made as part of my final piece for my foundation degree at Leeds College of Art back in 2017. There are two sets of prints; one depicting a good morning and one depicting a bad morning. The different colours were chosen through a survey that I posted on Facebook with the question “What Colour was your morning?”.

                        Between 2017 and 2019 I spent three summers and a winter working on the Isle of Sark, a small island situated in the Channel Islands situated between Guernsey and Jersey. The island is tiny and has no cars or street lights so you feel like you’ve travelled back in time. In 2020 I made this map of Sark using Photoshop and Illustrator, highlighting some of the destinations to visit on the island.
