                    Flicker Through is a design proposal that I pitched as part of a group to Flickr Foundation for one of my second year university projects. 
                    <br><br>
                    The brief we received, in a nutshell was to think of a new form of creative archive which would allow a user to interact with the over 50 billion images kept on Flickr. One of the considerations was to think about how this creative archive could last for, and be relevant in 100 years time. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our proposal was to build an app which would place Flickr images onto a map in the exact location that the image was shot (by either using the geotagging information available or users manually adding images to the map if they recognise where it was shot). People can then open the app in a location and view the map and images allowing them to make comparisons between the images and what the place looks like today. 
                    <br><br>
                    The app would also include a timeline feature so a person can choose to view images taken from specific points in time. 
                    <br><br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class ="projectPicsSection">
                <img class ="projectPics" src ="Img/Flicker Through/flickerThrough_4.png">
                <p class ="picDescription">Mock ups of app pages. From Left to Right: Directions Page (showing a location on the map after searching a location), Un-located images page (Depicting images that are lacking geotagging information that can be added to the map), List view of images</p>
            </div>
            <div class ="projectDescriptionSection">
                <p class ="wordsWidth description">
                    The significance of the app would grow over time as more images are contributed to the app, via Flickr. 100 years from now a person could view an extensive catalogue of images with exact locations, allowing them to see the transformation of a place over 100 years.
                    <br><br>
                    Flickr also has a large catalogue of images that predate its creation through individual users and the Flickr Commons (official archiving bodies that store images on Flickr). Therefore there is the potential to extend the timeline backwards as well as forwards.
                    <br><br>
                    This then has the potential of being an extensive archive of photography, as well as an archive of places and Flickr images.
