                    A multidisciplinary designer currently studying BA Design at Goldsmiths, University of London.
                    <br>
                    My practice is mainly digital and incorporates graphic design, illustration, UI design, 3D Modelling (for product design), basic web development (I created this website from scratch using HTML,CSS and a little JavaScript) and a sound understanding of photography.
                    <br>
                    I enjoy developing skills to achieve outcomes. At the centre of my practice is the belief that design can better the world whether it is human experience or moving towards a more sustainable future.
                    <br>    
                    I am inspired by the everyday, the objects and systems that influence our human experience as well as looking back through history to think about the process that has lead to today. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Prior to studying at Goldsmiths I spent 5 years working full-time in the hospitality sector in various high-end hotels and restaurants. My experiences in hospitality ranged from housekeeping and front-of-house to working as a chef in a Michelin starred kitchen. My experience in hospitality means I have good communication skills, attention to detail and good organisational skills but the most valuable lesson I learned was to observe and consider customer experience and employee experience within the industry and I am eager to translate what I have learned into my design practice.
