                   My portfolio consists of a broad range of projects from publication design, illustration to digital product design and web development. With every project I have done I have taught myself and honed in different skills so I can create outcomes that are suitable to different briefs and expectations. Companies I have worked with include Flickr Foundation where I worked as a design intern and Chalet Chardons where I worked as a photographer. These experiences have taught me a lot about working collaboratively as part of a team, working to brand guidelines to create assets that can be used by the company as promotional materials. 
                  <br><br>
                  In my spare time I love cooking and DJing at home and I LOVE walking! I recently completed the Camino De Santiago which is a 780km walk across Spain.
                  <br><br>
                  If you are looking for an adaptable, multi-skilled and hardworking designer to join your team or to help you out with a project please reach out to me! I am always open for creative opportunities :)
