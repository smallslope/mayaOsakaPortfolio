                    “The Island of Seven Sins” is a fictional island based in the real world where they follow their own non-theistic religion called the Temple of Seven Sins. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was one of my second year projects at uni where we had to imagine a fictional group of people based off of real subcultures and materialise certain aspects of this fictional group. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The religion is based off of the Christian Seven Deadly Sins and at the centre of their belief system is the idea that good cannot exist without evil because of the human condition. The sins are perceived as being a spectrum. For example the spectrum of Wrath has love and courage on one end of the spectrum and anger, grief and depression on the other end of the spectrum and Gluttony has restraint and moderation on one end of the spectrum and overconsumption and addiction on the other. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The seven sins are treated like deities (similar to the Ancient Roman and Greek gods), each one has its own temple, celebrations, rituals and followers.

                    The sins are celebrated but also contemplated within each temple. For example the Temple of Gluttony hosts an annual food and drink festival which allows people to celebrate gluttonous behaviour. Meanwhile the same temple also offers support to those who struggle with overeating/over-drinking and addiction. 
                    The aim of the religion is to confront and meditate on ones ‘sins’ as oppose to suppressing them as a means of finding a healthy relationship with them.
